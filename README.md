### Prediction Loan Repayment

The dataset for this project is retrieved from kaggle, the home of Data Science.

The major aim of this project is to predict whether the customers will have their loan paid or not. Therefore, this is a supervised classification problem to be trained.

### Prediction

Prediction the Accuracy of the model using four Machine Learning Algorithms, they are

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree 
3. Random Forest
4. KNearest Neighbors
5. Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

### CONCLUSION

The Loan Status is heavily dependent on the Credit History for Predictions.

The Logistic Regression algorithm gives us the maximum Accuracy (80%) compared to the other 4 Machine Learning Classification Algorithms.
